###Task description: Multi agent collaborative space mining

**Goal:**
Train multiple intelligent agents (mining robots) to collaborate in collecting asteroid resources in the space environment and transporting them back to the mother ship, while managing energy and avoiding collisions.

**Initial conditions:**
-2-4 intelligent agents randomly distributed in a 3D space environment
-Multiple asteroids are randomly distributed, each containing a different amount of resources
-The mother ship is located at the center of the environment
-Each intelligent agent has initial energy and zero inventory

**Behavioral requirements:**
1. Collaborative Mining: Intelligent agents should coordinate their actions to jointly search for and mine resource rich asteroids
2. Energy Management: The intelligent agent needs to efficiently use energy and return to the mother ship for charging when needed
3. * * Collision Avoidance * *: Intelligent agents should avoid collisions with other intelligent agents or asteroids
4. * * Effective Communication * *: Intelligent agents should utilize communication capabilities to share key information (such as resource location)
5. * * Resource Optimization * *: Intelligent agents should prioritize the extraction of high-value/high-efficiency resources

**Physical characteristics:**
-Newtonian mechanics in 3D space (thrust, mass, inertia)
-Simplified gravity field (from mother ship)
-Collision detection and physical response
-Energy consumption is directly proportional to action

**Termination conditions:**
-All intelligent agents have exhausted their energy
-Reaching the maximum number of steps (1000 steps)
-All resources have been extracted

**Evaluation indicators:**
1. * * Team Efficiency * *: The total amount of resources successfully transported back to the mother ship
2. * * Energy Efficiency * *: The amount of resources extracted and transported per unit of energy
3. * * Collaboration Level * *: The effectiveness of task division and information sharing
4. * * Survival time * *: The length of time the agent remains active

**Reward design considerations:**
-Successfully transporting resources back to the mother ship should receive higher rewards
-Collaborative behavior between intelligent agents should be encouraged
-Collisions and energy depletion should be punished
-Effective communication and information sharing should be rewarded

**Challenge:**
1. Partial observability: Each agent can only perceive a limited range of environment
2. * * Resource allocation * *: Balancing decisions need to be made between multiple resource points
3. * * Long term planning * *: Need to balance short-term gains and long-term strategies
4. * * Dynamic Environment * *: NPC competitors will also acquire resources
5. * * Communication Strategy * *: Need to develop effective and resource efficient communication protocols
